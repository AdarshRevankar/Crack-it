### REGRESSION PROBLEM
---
Regression Problem is to fine the correlation between the attributes to the dependent variable (eg: revenue depends on employees). This can be found out by using the ```Pearson's Equation``` to find the Coefficient of Correlation. Which is defined below

Using this ```r```, we can select the best attribute that correlates with the Y. Hence, we can find the best fit for the regression points. This can be computed using, <br>
``` Y = BX + A ``` where, ```Y``` is dependent variable and ```X``` is independent variable, ```B``` is slope & ```A``` is intercept of the Linear Equation.
```  B = Sum(X) * r /Sum(Y) ``` 
``` A = Y` - B * X` ``` where ``` Y` ```is mean of ```Y```, ``` X` ``` is mean of ```X``
