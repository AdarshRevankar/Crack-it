## FIND SQUARES PROBLEM
---
To identify number of squares present given points in 2D space.

#### Input
1. First line contains N, which is number of points to be given
1. Further lines contain ```x y```, coordinate points ```x``` and ```y``` separated with space
---
#### Output
Output should contain integer specifying number of squares present by the combination of coordinates

---
#### Examples
input 1
```
4
1 0
0 1
1 1
0 0
```
output 1
```
1
```
Explanation: For the given input-1 we can form one squares with coordinate positions ```(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)```

---
input 2
```
7
1 0
0 1
1 1
0 0
2 2
2 0
0 2
```
output 2
```
2
```
Explanation: For the given input-2 we can form two squares with coordinate positions ```(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)``` and ```(0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2)```
